# This example aims to test for issues in https://github.com/conda/conda-lock/issues/253
# The core issue is when multiple conda packages map to the same pip package name. Here,
# conda has dask and dask-core that both map to the pypi package dask. This would cause
# confusion when finalizing the resolved environment
